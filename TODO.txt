 - organize within each array, align by start/end.  then arrange array as a whole by start end.
 
MAYBE these items are arranged during the contraction process itself!  so then only have to flip items as needed.

strongly suspect i'm doing contraction hierarchy just a tiny bit wrong
 if i reconstruct the length from the pieces, every so often there might be a route that doesnt add up the same as total_cost.
  i know why, in that case.  the contraction is correct, but not storing the true contracted route.


criminally slow conversion of CH to geojson
  - array of attrs for contracted nodes
  - got to figure out how to create a correctly ordered attrs array during contraction
  - its okay to spend extra time during contraction!

eventually need to run USA network through refinement procedures
