Uhg all messed up.

think so much confusion when working with node ids and edge ids its easy to confuse the two.

CRUX is that my link{} shows a very unusual distribution

line 553, then line 1007
 
these items are arranged during the contraction process itself!  so then only have to flip items as needed.
 -you can do it in a SWEEP step at the end.
 -detangle will still need to be done at query runtime (can be an option - not always needed)

duplicating (reverse) geometry and attributes may make it possible to not need to detangle

eventually need to run USA network through refinement procedures
