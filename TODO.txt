dont need to go full contraction??  (issue is the last 1% of contraction takes sooo long , how much speedup does it really provide)

coordinate lookup 
  - coordinate lookup needs to read reverse_adj??

... return edge id and geojson representations

non-geojson interface

directed graphs:

think more deeply about adj list and reverse adj list
  - lots more testing around directed graphs

implement in Golang
