just because its working doesnt mean its correct

test a directed network

Non-GeoJSON data


try to build reverse_adjacency_list (on Load) so that it doesn't have to be saved/reloaded


- variable names and comments to distinguish whether youre working on an edge id or a node or coordinate (addEdge)
- strike all language regarding coords, as that wont always be applicable, and you always mean NODES anyways
- same for anything that says index


coordinate lookup almost assuredly broken

reorganize code

tests now that design has been firmed up.


eventually need to run USA network through refinement procedures
