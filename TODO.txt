CH
----------
reverse_adj list on CH broken
AStar the CH (routing)?
apply A* to network contraction (building)?
add outputFunctions (like in geojson dijkstra)
directed graph (start from beginning)
load / save keeping minimal memory footprint
publish CH

Geojson Dijkstra
------------
loadFromGeoJson should be replaced by new Graph(geojson)!
mutate inputs documentation
API change: findPath, findAStar
re-benchmark geojson-dijkstra vs ngraph
directed graph (start from beginning)
load / save keeping minimal memory footprint
re-publish geojson dijkstra 2.0 with updated info about CH


BENCHMARK SO FAR
--------
Benchmark faf.geojson, CA, OR, WA

TimeToContract: 209868, 163293
ngraph:         92250,  118702
ch:             14319,  5188

OTHER
------

join alike and cut at intersections should have a recompute line length option
where should create-network live? it's specific to faf


BUILDING CH && ARCFLAGS
---------------------------

make contraction hierarchy building process faster
-limit hops speed up contraction hierarchy?

michigan non-contiguous kmeans -is this a problem?  Research METIS

Cut ArcFlags processing time by using contraction hierarchy instead of std dijkstra

2 tiered arcFlags??


BIG PICTURE
--------------

Integrate CH with ArcFlags - if it doesnt immediately improve performance... can it!

golang or native node addon build-hierarchy and build-arcflags

C++ implementation for runDijkstra webAssembly
