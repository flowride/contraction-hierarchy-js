DATA OPTIMIZATIONS
------------------

OMG are you not recalculating distances when you split lines???!?!?!?!

function for cost field (probably set this up to calculate _cost)

TEST directed graph

manual graph creation api (as alternative to creating adjacency list from geojson)

benchmark vs ngraph?

faster-dijkstra package

tailor new dijkstra to all alternate uses (contraction hierarchy and arcflags)


BUILDING CH && ARCFLAGS
---------------------------

make contraction hierarchy building process faster
-limit hops speed up contraction hierarchy?

michigan non-contiguous kmeans -is this a problem?  Research METIS

Cut ArcFlags processing time by using contraction hierarchy instead of std dijkstra

2 tiered arcFlags??


BIG PICTURE
--------------

Integrate CH with ArcFlags

golang or native node addon build-hierarchy and build-arcflags

C++ implementation for runDijkstra webAssembly
