DATA OPTIMIZATIONS
------------------

use the same edge hash - don't do
 - Directed graph options
 - store edge hash once for each node pair.  forward and reverse flag for arc flags.


speedwise would help a bit if edge hash distance lookup could be replaced by storing cost in adjacency list
- may not be practical

benchmark vs ngraph?


BUILDING CH && ARCFLAGS (probably defer to the golang implementation)
---------------------------
michigan non-contiguous kmeans -is this a problem?  Research METIS

make contraction hierarchy building process faster
-limit hops speed up contraction hierarchy?

SEEMS LIKE YOU COULD DRASTICALLY CUT ARCFLAGS PROCESSING TIME IF CALCULATING SHORTEST PATHS THROUGH CONTRACTION HIERARCHIES

2 tiered arcFlags??


BIG PICTURE
--------------

Integrate CH with ArcFlags

golang build-hierarchy and build-arcflags

C++ implementation for runDijkstra webAssembly
